.SH DESCRIPTION

.B devd-mount
is a script for mounting external media on FreeBSD.  It is
normally invoked by /usr/local/etc/devd/devd-mount.conf,
which is run by the devd(8) service upon creation of
a new device node such as /dev/da0.  This typically occurs
when a USB drive is inserted, for example.

The device name should contain a filesystem recognized
by FreeBSD or by fusefs, such as EXFAT, FAT32, FAS16, NTFS,
ISO 9660 (CDs), UDF (DVDs), of UFS (FreeBSD native).

The mount point for a device is /media/device-name, e.g.
/dev/da0p1 is mounted on /media/da0p1.

The configuration file /usr/local/etc/devd-mount.conf
can be used to control
ownership and permissions on the mount point, and the program
invoked upon a successful mount.  Defaults are shown below.

.na
MEDIA_MANAGER=/usr/local/bin/qmediamanager
GROUP=operator
MODE=775
.ad

The auto-automount-setup(1) script, part of sysutils/auto-admin
will configure a FreeBSD system to use devd-mount.

.SH RETURN VALUES

0 upon successful mount, non-zero error codes otherwise
